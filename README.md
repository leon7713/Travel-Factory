#TRAVELFACTORY - Translator APPLICATION#

Welcome to our test! 
The goal of this test is to create an application to manage our translations.

### Please note, you need to create a C# server (a database is optional). This test is full-stack (front end (HTML, CSS, JS) and back end).

## Context ##
At TravelFactory, we have many applications that each need to have a translation for every element of their interface. For this purpose, we use translation files in JSON format. However, this format is not practical for business teams. Additionally, deploying the translations to production requires a developer to check and copy the file to the server.

To resolve this problem, the project manager and the business teams decided to create a centralized application to manage all the translations made on the user interfaces. This interface must allow users to enter, download, and deploy application translations.

This application consists of two screens.

### The first screen allows you to: ###
View the list of existing applications.
Add an application: a popup is displayed to enter the name of the application.
Clicking on the "Download XLSX" button will download an Excel file containing all the translations for the application.
The "Deploy" button allows you to save the translations in JSON format to a server directory containing the name of the app, for example, "/translator/app1.json".

### The next screen allows you to: ###
Add translation keys for a selected app.

### You have 4 hours to complete this project. ###

### When the project is finished, please commit it to the Bitbucket account. ###
